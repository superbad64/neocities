					I actually don't have a whole lot to say about this case, not that it's a bad thing. It went through a fair amount of revisions - the first few were made to be one-shot chassis printable on my old SOVOL SV06+, which has a 300 by 300mm print area. Later, in an effort to make it more "accessible", I split it into parts that could fit on a more standard 220 by 220mm print bed.

					This case supports 24mm screw-in buttons<sup id="footnote-1-orig"><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> as well as low and flat collar joysticks. It's still a fairly cramped build though, while a standard Brook harness will fit you'll have to compress everything a little bit with the bottom plates.

					I really don't know what to add to that ! It's a very solid baseline case with a good feature set and buildability. And it's rather inexpensive to boot, I clocked it at roughly 550 grams (depending on infill of course), so barely over half of a spool ! Go print it now !!
