				<strong>Q: So what's the deal with the retro themes ?</strong><br>
				In very succint terms, I <i>profundly</i> despise modern UI design, not just web design. I think smartphones made us walk back on every good UX design made in the early days of the Internet in the name of uniformization, and this quite honestly makes me sad ! The Web 1.0 used to be a much more vibrant, lively place than the modern aseptized corporate drivel we're algorithmically served every day. Consider this website as a futile but stalwart attempt at recapturing some of this elder magic.<br>
				<br>
				<strong>Q: You do know that your colors are all wrong, don't you ?</strong><br>
				Yeah I do. Think of it as more of an imitation rather than an attempt to outright copy old Windows GUI.<br>
				<br>
				<strong>Q: What framework did you use ?</strong><br>
				None. This is pure handwritten HTML with light touches of vanillaJS. No framework, no AI, no problem.<br>
				Oh and there is no backend either, as I deemed it superfluous considering I don't blog that much. It does use a generator script written in Python but that's about it.<br>

				<strong>Q: Where can I purchase your arcade controllers ?</strong><br>
				You can't <i>yet</i>. I'm working on it !<br>
				<br>
				<strong>Q: Any shortlist of what you're working on ?</strong><br>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>More cases (actually just one at the time)</li>
					<li>A handheld controller</li>
					<li>A DualShock 2 modkit (potentially redundant with the above)</li>
					<li>Eventually I'd <i>like</i> to make my own retro handheld console based on the Raspberry Pi Compute Module, but that's probably not happening in 2026</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
				<strong>Q: Why the DualShock 2 ?</strong><br>
				Honestly it's a toss-up between it and the DS3. I happen to have never owned a PlayStation 3 in the first place so I'm just going with the DS2 out of habit.<br>

				I don't really expect too many personal questions, but once in a blue moon one or two will likely trickle down here.<br>
				<br>
				<strong>Q: Just... why ?</strong><br>
				Starting with the loaded questions, are we ? :-P<br>
				I guess I needed a personal expression space on the Internet. My own little corner of the web. I've always wanted my own website but never really had much to publish. Still don't, in fact, as you can probably tell by the rather barebones Projects section (more will come, don't worry !)<br>
				</br>
				<strong>Q: Any game recs ?</strong><br>
				I'm particularly fond of Hypnospace Outlaw, Progressbar95, Stardew Valley, Elden Ring and Kingsway. Pretty good ways to eat my free time when I'm not writing code ;-)<br>
				<br>
				<strong>Q: Why the Windows themes ? Aren't you a Linux guy ?</strong><br>
				To be honest Linux isn't really known for having iconic GUIs - if anything it's the <i>opposite</i>, Linux is more known for its CLI than anything else. (And I don't want to write an ersatz of GTK3 in CSS)<br>
