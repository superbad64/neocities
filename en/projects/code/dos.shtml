					I feel like I'm the only guy my age who has fond memories of DOS. Of course, for me it was only a means to an end back then, specifically that end being to launch whatever game I was gonna play that day, usually some form of educational game like Adibou since the only DOS machine I had access to was at school. My first home computer already had Windows 95.<br>
					<br>
					Like most of what I write nowadays, it's a rather jumbled blob of stream-of-consciousness vanilla(-ish) JavaScript with a few <s>war crimes</s> questionable design choices. Most notably, I re-use some object-targeting code a couple times throughout, which normally means I should turn that bit of code into a function, but scope and lack of foresight made it harder than it needs to be<sup id="footnote-1-orig"><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup><br>
					<br>
					There are a few anachronisms, of course. System32 wasn't present on DOS (which makes sense - DOS is <i>16</i> bit), and neither was user management in the first place; that feature was actually part of a different DOS, specifically Novell Multiuser DOS (who'd have thought !)<br>
					<br>
					I made the virtual filesystem<sup id="footnote-2-orig"><a href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup> read-only out of both convenience and ease of coding. Would have loved to include the EDIT command but this sounds like a local storage nightmare waiting to happen.<br>
					<br>
					All in all, despite some flaws like word wrapping being perfectible (to say the least), I quite like this thing. Brings back the good vibes, doesn't it ?<br>
