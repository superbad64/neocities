					Lack of employment perspectives (mainly due to my current state of existence) is making me heavily consider using my last funds to buy a truck and turn it into a camper of sorts. This would involve letting go of most of my hobbies (can't really 3D print on a car battery, can I ?), but at this point I feel like I don't have any choice either way. It's that or a motorcycle and a prayer that I can find some work real soon.<br>

					(Yeah it's almost 2 in the morning when I'm posting this. Insomnia ahh fueled coding sesh)<br>
					<br>
					I added a couple dark styles for those among you whose eyes hurt when looking at something mildly bright on a screen. (I won't blame you, I'm part of that crowd lmao)<br>
					Also yeah I'm aware the menu is a lil bit borked on mobile at the moment, trying to see why.<br>

					Not that it should be very visible to most of you, but I changed most of the code that runs the site, mostly for layout consistency across devices and eventually frameworking. Took me most of the day, so definitely up there in terms of productive uses of my time lmao<br>
					<br>
					Anyways, hope y'all enjoying the Christmas season ! Not particularly fond of it myself for <i>reasons</i>, but don't let that stop you. I'm not the Grinch !<br>

					Hey, been a month already huh ? Time does fly when I work on the things y'all can't really see on this site hehe.<br>
					I mean you <i>can</i> sorta see some of them, like the new landing page with language selection and the DOS-like style I added... But there's also a lot more going on like a new (and much cleaner) way to load stylesheets in what passes as the back-end. Not that it should really impact your navigation experience, it just makes things easier to maintain and expand on my end, mostly !<br>
					<br>
					Either way, we're closing in on November, and the holiday cheer is well and truly present around here. Hope everything goes well this season too. Let's try to not drink too much hot cocoa ! (No chance lmao)<br>

					Finally done translating everything I wrote (so far) in French ! I also globally enabled the style selector rather than relegating it to an easter egg. Makes more sense given that styles now persist across site visits !<br>
					<br>
					I also tweaked the styles a little bit more for the occasion. Added some buttons and whatnot. Hope that looks good !<br>
