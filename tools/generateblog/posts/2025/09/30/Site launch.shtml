Well, here we are. I'm (finally) launching this website I've been bothering pretty much everyone about for the past five months or so.<br>
<br>
It's been an eventful road. I'm not a developer, much less a web developer (if anything I mostly write either administration scripts or low level code for embedded microcontrollers). The design alone took quite a lot of time. I created two stylesheets, one themed around Windows 9x and one around Windows XP. Still not entirely sure which one looks best.<br>
<br>
Either way, that's that. Hope you enjoy your stay !
