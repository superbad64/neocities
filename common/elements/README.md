To explain a little bit what's going on here: I blindly wrote this website using something called Server Side Includes, in order to reuse elements like the navbbar(s) and the footer. Turns out NeoCities doesn't support this, which of course I found out after opening an account.

What NeoCities *does* support, however, is JavaScript. So with the help of [a little tool I cobbled together](../../tools/html2js), I turned these HTML elements into very dirty JS imports.

If it's stupid and it works...
